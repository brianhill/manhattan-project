Course [home page](./)

### Week 1

* Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 10 &mdash; Preface and Chapter 1 (Overview) from *The History and Science of the Manhattan Project, 2nd Edition,* 2019, by Bruce Cameron Reed
* Tuesday, Jan. 10 &mdash; Discussion of Preface and Chapter 1, particularly the reasons for studying the Manhattan Project at a semi-technical level, key dates in WWII (1939, 1941, and 1945) &mdash; First assignment, due Tuesday, Jan. 17 (see below) &mdash; Remainder of class, lecture on [Elements and Energy](./resources/elements_and_energy.html)
* Preparation for Friday, Jan. 13 &mdash; pp. 19-36 of Chapter 2 of *The History and Science of the Manhattan Project, 2nd Edition,* 2019, by Bruce Cameron Reed &mdash; Ignore Equations 2.1-2.8 on pp. 26-27. They are college sophomore math. I will be able to explain them to you. Maybe on Friday.
* Friday, Jan. 13 &mdash; We analyzed the overlapping discoveries and terminology of early nuclear chemists and early particle physicists: &alpha; particles, &beta; rays, &gamma; rays, electrons, and X-rays (two pairs in these five are arguably redundant) &mdash; We discussed the cathode ray tube (also known as the Crooke's tube) &mdash; We did an accurate, but without-calculus derivation of the fundamental exponential decay equations (equations (2.1)-(2.3)) &mdash; We did a naive definition of the mol, and then we discussed how isotopic abundance and the mass defect both force upon us a more precise definition of mol and N\_A &mdash; We started using three hand-outs: Table of Isotopic Masses, Graph of Isotopes Color-Coded by Decay Type, and the Binding Energy or Mass Defect Graph (and we will continue learning to use these handouts next time)
