## Manhattan Project &mdash; Daily Schedule &mdash; Term 4

Course [home page](./)

### Week 1

* Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 10 &mdash; Preface and Chapter 1 (Overview) from *The History and Science of the Manhattan Project, 2nd Edition,* 2019, by Bruce Cameron Reed
* Tuesday, Jan. 10 &mdash; Discussion of Preface and Chapter 1, particularly the reasons for studying the Manhattan Project at a semi-technical level, key dates in WWII (1939, 1941, and 1945) &mdash; First assignment, due Tuesday, Jan. 17 (see below) &mdash; Remainder of class, lecture on [Elements and Energy](./resources/elements_and_energy.html)
* Preparation for Friday, Jan. 13 &mdash; pp. 19-36 of Chapter 2 of *The History and Science of the Manhattan Project, 2nd Edition,* 2019, by Bruce Cameron Reed &mdash; Ignore Equations 2.1-2.8 on pp. 26-27. They are college sophomore math. I will be able to explain them to you. Maybe on Friday.
* Friday, Jan. 13 &mdash; We analyzed the overlapping discoveries and terminology of early nuclear chemists and early particle physicists: &alpha; particles, &beta; rays, &gamma; rays, electrons, and X-rays (two pairs in these five are arguably redundant) &mdash; We discussed the cathode ray tube (also known as the Crooke's tube) &mdash; We did an accurate, but without-calculus derivation of the fundamental exponential decay equations (equations (2.1)-(2.3)) &mdash; We did a naive definition of the mol, and then we discussed how isotopic abundance and the mass defect both force upon us a more precise definition of mol and N\_A &mdash; We started using three hand-outs: [Isotope Table](./resources/IsotopeTable.pdf), [Isotope Plot](./resources/IsotopePlot.pdf) Color-Coded by Decay Type, and the Binding Energy or [Mass Defect Plot](./resources/MassDefecctPlot.pdf) (and we will continue learning to use these handouts next time)

### Week 2

* Preparation for Tuesday, Jan. 17 &mdash; Email me [Assignment 1 - Essay Draft](./assignments/Assignment01.pdf) before class &mdash; Continue reading in Chapter 2 to p. 45 &mdash; The author's discussion of major discoveries has often been insufficiently detailed in terms of what the actual experiments were (as opposed to the experiment's results) &mdash; Therefore, let's individually research and prepare as follows: Trey, Crooke's Tube and Cathode rays (the electron); Brandon, Roentgen discovers X-rays; Anna, The Curies isolate polonium and radium; Mac, Aston discovers many isotopes with mass spectrometry; Norah, Rutherford demonstrates that alpha particles are Helium nuclei &mdash; Say as much as you can and think is important in each of these discoveries, especially how the experiments were actually done, in as much as five minutes (feel free to share handouts of materials that you consulted)
* Tuesday, Jan. 17
* Preparation for Friday, Jan. 20 &mdash; Turn in Assignment 2 which will be handed out on Tuesday &mdash; Reading assignment - FORTHCOMING - but likely to go to p. 61
* Friday, Jan. 20
