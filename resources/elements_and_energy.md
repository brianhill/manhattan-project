## Elements and Energy

*This is just an outline/reminder of what was covered. Come to me with questions if you want it reviewed, especially scientific notation, which we spent very little time on.*

* High-level view of the electromagnetic spectrum 
   * radio waves
   * microwaves
   * infrared
   * ROYGBIV
     * red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, as enumerated by Newton
	 * or just RGB for for those of us that can see the usual three primary colors (many people are red-green colorblind)
	 * to our eyes, yellow can be made as a combination of red and green and cyan can be made as a combination of green and blue, and surprisingly, perhaps, purple can be made as a combination of red and blue
   * ultraviolet
   * X-rays
   * &gamma;-rays (but sometimes photons of all sorts are referred to by the symbol &gamma;)

* Definition of an element as number of protons in nucleus (that is what matters most, and everything else follows from that)
   * definition of isotope (same number of protons, but some other number of neutrons is same element, different isotope)
   * definition of ion (atom that is not neutral)
     * more electrons than protons makes a negative ion
	 * fewer electrons than protons makes a positive ion

* Constituents of matter
   * In the nucleus
     * proton &mdash; has a positive charge &mdash; +1.6x10^-19 C
     * neutron &mdash; is neutral
   * Surrounding the nucleus
     * electron &mdash; has a negative charge &mdash; -1.6x10^-19 C
	 * usually surrounding the nucleus is the same number of electrons as the number of protons
	   * atoms "like" to be neutral
	   * but atoms aren't always neutral, for example an electron can be stripped off, see ions above

* Units of charge and current
   * Coulomb, abbreviated C
   * Ampere, abbreviated A (but watch out for similarity to &Aring; which is a shorthand for 10^-10 m)
   * 1 Coulomb is 1 Ampere of current flowing for 1 second
   * So you say, "what is the definition of the Ampere?"
	 * And I sing, “We’re going to vent our frustration/If we don’t, we’re going to blow a 50-amp fuse.”
	 * Maybe The Rolling Stones had 50-amp fuses on some of their equipment? At 115V, that would be over 5000 Watts. Seems plausible for a big wall of PA gear or a big wall of lights.
	 * In any case, if The Rolling Stones have intuition for current, I am going to trust that you do too, and I won't try to define the Ampere, which is the unit of current. It isn't that hard, but we are getting far afield if we do.

* Meaning and implications of n + U &rarr; Ba + Kr + 3n
   * Chain reactions
   * 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, 729, ...

* Standard scientific units
   * mass, kilogram, abbreviated kg, the k in kg stands for kilo and means 1000
   * it is a little annoying that the standard unit for mass is 1000 times some other unit (the gram), but that's the choice that was made
   * Why didn't they just make the gram the standard unit? I dunno. They didn't.
   * distance, meter, abbreviated m
   * watch out, because italic *m* looks similar and is used as the variable for mass
   * furthermore non-italic m is also used as the abbreviation for milli, as in millimeter which is abbreviated mm
   * time, second, abbreviated s
   * energy, Joule, abbreviated J
   * 1 kg m/s^2 = 1 J

* Real-world example of 1 J
  * 100g tangerine dropped from a height of one meter in a gravitational field whose acceleration is approximately 10 m/s^2
  * 0.1 kg * 1 m * 10 m/s^2 = 1 J
  * If you dropped the tangerine from two meters, it would hit with an energy of 2 J

* Intuitive meaning of units of acceleration: m/s^2
  * m/s per second

* Examining units in the equation *E= mc*^2

* Example of a 1/5 gram coffee bean converted to energy using *E=mc*^2
  * 1/5000 kg * (3x10^8 m/s)^2 = 9/5 x 10^13 J
  * or 18,000,000,000,000 J
  * or the energy of 18 trillion tangerine drops
