## Elements and Energy

*As of yet, this is just an outline.*

High-level view of the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ROYGBIV or more simply RGB, ultraviolet, X-rays, &gamma;-rays)

Definition of an element as number of protons in nucleus, definition of isotope, definition of ion

Constituents of matter: protons, neutrons, and electrons

Units of charge and current (Coulomb and Ampere)

Meaning and implications of n + U &rarr; Ba + Kr + 3n

Standard scientific units of mass, distance, time, and energy (kilogram, abbreviated kg, meter, abbreviated m, second, abbreviated s, and Joule, abbreviated J)

Example with 100g tangerine dropped from one meter in a 10 m/s^2 gravitational field

Intuitive meaning of units of acceleration: m/s^2

Examining units in the equation E= mc^2

Example of a 1/5 gram coffee bean converted to energy using E=mc^2 (1/5000 kg * (3x10^8 m/s)^2 = 9/5 x 10^13 J or 18,000,000,000,000 J or 18 trillion tangerine drops, all at once)
