## Elements and Energy

*This is just an outline/reminder of what was covered. Come to me with questions if you want it reviewed, especially scientific notation, which we spent very little time on.*

* High-level view of the electromagnetic spectrum 
   * radio waves
   * microwaves
   * infrared
   * ROYGBIV
     * red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, as enumerated by Newton
	 * or just RGB for for those of us that can see the usual three primary colors (many people are red-green colorblind)
	 * to our eyes, yellow can be made as a combination of red and green and cyan can be made as a combination of green and blue, and surprisingly, perhaps, purple can be made as a combination of red and blue
   * ultraviolet
   * X-rays
   * &gamma;-rays (but sometimes photons of all sorts are referred to by the symbol &gamma;)

* Definition of an element as number of protons in nucleus
   * definition of isotope (same number of protons, varying number of neutrons)
   * definition of ion
     * too many electrons is a negative ion
	 * too few electrons is a positive ion

* Constituents of matter
   * In the nucleus
     * proton &mdash; has a positive charge &mdash; +1.6x10^-19 J
     * neutron &mdash; is neutral
   * Surrounding the nucleus
     * electron &mdash; has a negative charge &mdash; -1.6x10^-19 J
	 * usually surrounding the nucleus is the same number of electrons as the number of protons, but see ions

* Units of charge and current
   * Coulomb, abbreviated C
   * Ampere, abbreviated A (but watch out for similarity to &Aring; which is a shorthand for 10^-10 m)

* Meaning and implications of n + U &rarr; Ba + Kr + 3n

* Standard scientific units
   * mass, kilogram, abbreviated kg
   * distance, meter, abbreviated m &larr; but watch out because italic *m* looks similar and is used as the variable for mass
   * time, second, abbreviated s
   * energy, Joule, abbreviated J

* Example with 100g tangerine dropped from a height of 1 meter in an (approximately) 10 m/s^2 gravitational field
  * 0.1 kg * 1 m * 1 m/s^2 = 1 J

* Intuitive meaning of units of acceleration: m/s^2

* Examining units in the equation *E= mc*^2

* Example of a 1/5 gram coffee bean converted to energy using *E=mc*^2
  * 1/5000 kg * (3x10^8 m/s)^2 = 9/5 x 10^13 J
  * or 18,000,000,000,000 J
  * or the energy of 18 trillion tangerine drops
