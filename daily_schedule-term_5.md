### Week 8 (Mar. 12-18) &mdash; Creation and Refinement of Fissile Isotopes &mdash; Part II, Plutonium Production

* Preparation for Tuesday, Mar. 13 &mdash; Short Presentations: Trey, Experiments on animals and the beginnings of understanding radiation sickness; Brian, Thorium reactors; Mac, Diffusion membranes for clean water from seawater (as a way of learning more about gaseous diffusion) &mdash; Finish Chapter 5 (the thermal diffusion program), pp. 223-234
* Tuesday, Mar. 13 &mdash; Midterm class evaluations discussion &mdash; Presentations from Trey and Brian &mdash; S-50 (thermal diffusion) discussion &mdash; Mean free path problem (Problem 7 at the end of Chapter 5)
* Preparation for Friday, Mar. 16 &mdash; Turn in [Assignment 7](./assignments/Assignment07.pdf) &mdash; Short Presentations: Norah, Ruth Huddleston and what did the Calutron girls and other workers know; Trey, understanding medical ethics considerations for giving radioactive iron to pregnant mothers and radioactive iodine to babies (including dose and expected risk, informed consent, goals/benefits of these diagnostics and experiments, and the subsequent evolution of human subjects guidelines); Mac, Diffusion membranes for clean water from seawater (as a way of learning more about gaseous diffusion, assuming you are still interested in that subject); Mac 2, current status of Iran's U-235 and Pu-239 enrichment programs; Norah 2, economic sanctions and military threats and attacks on Iran to try to deter their nuclear program, including attacks on the gas centrifuges and the nuclear scientists &mdash; Go through Chapter 6 (the Hanford nuclear reactors), to p. 263 &mdash; For my (Brian's) contribution to the discussion of Sections 6.1 to 6.5, I will try to synthesize what we know about Hanford's reactor operation in terms of fundamental phenomenological facts including nuclear cross-sections for absorption, scattering, and fission, abundances, power generation, and energy per fission
