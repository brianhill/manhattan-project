### Week 8 (Mar. 12-18) &mdash; Creation and Refinement of Fissile Isotopes

* Preparation for Tuesday, Mar. 13 &mdash; Short Presentations: Trey, Experiments on animals and the beginnings of understanding radiation sickness; Brian, Thorium reactors; Mac, Diffusion membranes for clean water from seawater (as a way of learning more about gaseous diffusion) &mdash; Finish Chapter 5 (the thermal diffusion program), pp. 223-234
* Tuesday, Mar. 13 &mdash; [Midterm course evaluations](./course-evaluations/midterm_changes_to_course.html) discussion and outcomes &mdash; Presentations from Trey and Brian &mdash; S-50 (thermal diffusion) discussion &mdash; Mean free path problem (Reed Problem 5.7)
* Preparation for Friday, Mar. 16 &mdash; Turn in [Assignment 7](./assignments/Assignment07.pdf) &mdash; Short Presentations: Norah, Ruth Huddleston and what did the Calutron girls and other workers know; Trey, understanding medical ethics considerations for giving radioactive iron to pregnant mothers and radioactive iodine to babies (including dose and expected risk, informed consent, goals/benefits of these diagnostics and experiments, and the subsequent evolution of human subjects guidelines); Mac, Diffusion membranes for clean water from seawater (as a way of learning more about gaseous diffusion, assuming you are still interested in that subject); Mac 2, current status of Iran's U-235 and Pu-239 enrichment programs; Norah 2, economic sanctions and military threats and attacks on Iran to try to deter their nuclear program, including attacks on the gas centrifuges and the nuclear scientists &mdash; Go through Chapter 6 (the Hanford nuclear reactors), to p. 263 &mdash; For my (Brian's) contribution to the discussion of Sections 6.1 to 6.5, I will try to synthesize what we know about Hanford's reactor operation in terms of fundamental phenomenological facts including nuclear cross-sections for absorption, scattering, and fission, abundances, power generation, and energy per fission
* Friday, Mar. 16 &mdash; Turned in Problem Set 7 &mdash; Two presentations from Mac (diffusion membranes and Iran's nuclear enrichment program) and presentation from Trey (human subjects testing) &mdash; The layout of the Hanford complex near the convergence of the Columbia, the Yakima, and the Snake rivers &mdash; The problem of waste heat &mdash; The need for power &mdash; &mdash; The surprising 3,000,000 barn cross-section of Xenon

### Week 9 (Mar. 19-25) &mdash; Finish Hanford Reactor Complex &mdash; Begin Los Alamos

* Preparation for Tuesday, Mar. 20 &mdash; Short Presentations: Trey, the current status of spent fuel rod and other nuclear waste disposal at Yucca Mountain; Mac, the current status of groundwater contamination at Hanford &mdash; Finish reading Chapter 6 (the Hanford reactors) Sections 6.6 and 6.7, and begin reading Chapter 7 (Los Alamos) through 7.3, p. 286
* Tuesday, Mar. 20 &mdash;
* Preparation for Friday, Mar. 23 &mdash; Continue reading Chapter 7 through Section 7.7.2, p. 312 &mdash; Prepare to discuss or present a solution of Problem 7.4 on p. 376 (which is directly related to the fizzle problem) &mdash; Look at my copy of Richard Rhodes, *The Making of the Atomic Bomb,* and decide if you want to read selections from it (I filed my copy on the library shelves at call number 539.71) &mdash; You have hard-copy [*Los Alamos from Below*](./resources/LosAlamosFromBelow.pdf) by Richard Feynman that you can get started on, but I am not imagining that we discuss it until Tuesday, Mar. 27 &mdash; Here is soft-copy of [*The Los Alamos Primer*](./resources/LosAlamosPrimer.pdf) in case you are curious what scientists arriving at the project were given as a starting point
* Friday, Mar. 23 &mdash; Approximations for computing annuli volumes &mdash; How half-lives for different decay modes combine &mdash; Mean free paths &mdash; Causes of premature detonation in U-235 (mostly alpha decays and impurities) &mdash; Causes of premature detonation in Pu-239 (mostly spontaneous fissions of Pu-240)

### Week 10 (Mar. 26-Apr. 1)

* Preparation for Tuesday, Mar. 27 &mdash; Continue reading Chapter 7 to the start of Section 7.11 (through p. 326) &mdash; Pick a chapter (or two!) from the Richard Rhodes classic (I filed my copy on the library shelves at call number 539.71) &mdash; Finish  [*Los Alamos from Below*](./resources/LosAlamosFromBelow.pdf) by Richard Feynman
