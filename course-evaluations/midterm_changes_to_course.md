## Manhattan Project &mdash; Midterm Changes to Course

Course [home page](../)

Per the discussion on March 14th, we are making the following adjustments to the course:

* Do more student presentations (essentially a presentation by each student in each class)
* Do more problems in-class
* Do algebraic demonstrations more slowly (everyone wanted this!)
* Either figure out a way to make the no-calculus explanations of differential equations more intelligible or give up on them

For more details on the discussions from which these changes came, see the [Midterm Course Evaluations](./MidtermCourseEvaluations.pdf)
